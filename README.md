# notefkr
Audio rate MIDI device

Arpeggiates MIDI notes at audio rate; an input of A4 will output A4 at 440hz for the period the note is held. Allows for Karplus-Strong monophonic synthesis on simple audio sources such as drum machines.

Revisions include independent velocity control, intended for use with M4L envelopes before the nfkr device.
